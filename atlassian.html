            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p class="body-p">Confluence is a content collaboration tool used to help teams
                collaborate and share knowledge efficiently. You can read more
                about the product’s specific capabilities and features
                <a class="confl-link" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence?=undefined&aceid=&adposition=1t1&adgroup=56762718378&campaign=1398156449&creative=377209412295&device=c&keyword=confluence&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p32969177752&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001542923&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5IG_rqvP5AIV0cDICh2sJQJaEAAYASAAEgJUrvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">here.</a>
                <br><br>
                I was asked to focus on Confluence's mobile experience, a part of
                the product which had not yet received much design attention.
                I was given a lot of freedom to define my project's problem space
                more specifically. My process is delineated below.</p>

                <h2>Process Overview</h2>
                <p class="body-p">My process began with a comprehensive evaluation of the app’s functionality
                    across platforms and devices. I then dug into research/metrics in
                    order to develop personas, map their most common journeys, identify
                    pain points, and ideate solutions. I worked with mobile developers
                    to weigh anticipated impacts of each solution against the cost to
                    implement it, and prioritized my list of problems/solutions.
                    <br> <br>
                    Upon identifying the problem I would be designing for, I conducted
                    a competitive analysis of how other products handle similar user needs.
                    I began ideating, sketching, mocking up, prototyping, and iterating.
                    Along the way, I worked to prioritize accessibility best practices,
                    I restructured information, collaborated with copywriters, altered
                    visuals, designed new icons when necessary, and checked in regularly
                    with the Atlassian Design Guidelines Team to be sure my work was ADG
                    compliant.</p>

                    <h2>Audit & Preliminary Research</h2>
                    <p class="body-p">I first needed to familiarize myself with the
                        product -- learn its capabilities and use cases, understand its
                        structure, etc. So, I began my process with a comprehensive
                        audit of the current mobile app: documenting all screens,
                        functionality, bugs, and taking particular note of where
                        microinteractions and animations could be added in order to
                        inject user delight at a low cost. I repeated the audit across
                        platforms and devices, then compiled my findings and shared
                        them with the Confluence team.
                        <br><br>
                        I also sat down with user researchers and dug into metrics and
                        qualitative findings on the ways in which users interact with
                        the mobile app vs. the desktop product.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p class="body-p">With a list of users’ top tasks and motivations on
                        Confluence mobile, I developed three personas (theoretical users
                        meant to represent the needs, actions, and reactions of a larger
                        group of users):

                            <p class="specifics">Alana is great at motivating a team
                                along when times get tough. She constantly drives
                                for outcomes and feels that details get in the
                                way when she’s busy, (which, if you’ve had a
                                meeting with her, you’d realize is almost always).
                                She abhors admin work or things that get in her way.
                                In her workplace, she prefers direct communication
                                from her colleagues and managers.

                                Jose gains great satisfaction from helping his
                                team and/ or customers. He doesn’t mind putting
                                in the hours, and he tends to put people in touch
                                with each other if he thinks they’ll both benefit.
                                He tries to make everyone happy, even if he doesn’t
                                get what he wants, and he’s comfortable with
                                following an endorsed process.

                                Jose can be a bit hesitant, and if he thinks
                                something can be done better, he’d rather check
                                with everyone first before diving in himself to
                                change it. Not many people know this, but he plays
                                guitar in a cover band, and loves Moroccan food.

                    <h2>Journey Mapping</h2>
                    <p class="body-p">
                        Based on the personas developed above, and the top task
                        findings from the research team, I mapped out probable
                        user journeys. This was far more an exercise in user
                        empathy than in analytics.
                        <br><br>
                        I used blue stickies to represent each step of the
                        current journey, pink stickies to record sentiments
                        along the way and to identify pain points, and yellow
                        stickies for potential solutions and alterations to the
                        interface. Underneath the sticky note mappings, I roughly
                        charted the personas sentiments over the course of the
                        journey.

                            This exercise really helped me to
                            accelerate the process of identifying major user
                            pain points within the mobile experience, and to
                            better understand the needs and motivations of
                            users.

                        <p class="body-p">
                            As I entered the solution-ideation
                            phase of my process, I spent some time reviewing
                            the parameters I would have to account for, like
                            design guidelines (Material Design, Human Interface
                            Guidelines, and Atlassian’s own design language -- ADG)
                            and accessibility best practices (Web Content Accessibility
                            Guidelines). I also began to pay closer attention to
                            the apps I use the most, why I use them, and at which
                            moments I find myself the most ‘delighted’ by them.

                        <h2>Solution Ideation & Prioritization</h2>
                        <p class="body-p">
                            I built a table like the one below to use for
                            solution ideation and impact evaluation (columns 1-4).
                            I then handed it off to an Android and an iOS
                            engineer to fill out the last two columns with their
                            predictions of how much effort each proposed solution
                            would require on the development side.

                        <p class="body-p">
                            With the table all filled out, I sat down with my
                            team triad (product manager, designer, and head
                            engineer) to discuss which of my target problems/
                            potential solutions struck the best balance between
                            maximizing impact while minimizing effort and cost.

                        <h2>Iterative Design</h2>
                        <p class="body-p">
                            With a clearly defined problem space and a boatload
                            of ideas for how to address it, I jumped into
                            sketching possible new user flows, interfaces,
                            shortcuts, etc. Based on these early sketches, I
                            crafted rough mockups and ‘sparred’ them with the
                            design team to get feedback.
                            <br><br>
                            This kicked off the process of designing, soliciting
                            feedback via testing and critiques, redesigning, and
                            so on and so forth until I landed on my finalized
                            concept and design.

                    <h2>Result</h2>
                    <p class="body-p">I ended up creating a feature that I’m
                        super excited to see roll out in the coming months.
                        It capitalizes on mobile capabilities in order to
                        reduce user anxiety related to on-the-go page creation.
                        It challenges desktop-first mental models and truly
                        takes mobile users’ needs into account.
