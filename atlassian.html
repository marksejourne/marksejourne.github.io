        <p class="disclaimer">While I am unable to publicly present my final
            designs for Atlassian at this time, I have
            documented as much of my process as possible
            below. Please reach out via my Contact page
            if you’d like to hear more about my work on
            the Confluence app.</p>

    <div class="bodycontent-div">
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p class="body-p">Confluence is a content collaboration tool used to help teams
            collaborate and share knowledge efficiently. You can read more
            about the product’s specific capabilities and features
            <a class="confl-link" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence?=undefined&aceid=&adposition=1t1&adgroup=56762718378&campaign=1398156449&creative=377209412295&device=c&keyword=confluence&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p32969177752&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001542923&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5IG_rqvP5AIV0cDICh2sJQJaEAAYASAAEgJUrvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">here.</a> </p>

        <h2>Process Overview</h2>
        <p class="body-p">I was asked to focus on the Confluence mobile experience. My process
            began with a comprehensive evaluation of the app’s functionality
            across platforms and devices. I then dug into research/metrics in
            order to develop personas, map their most common journeys, identify
            pain points, and ideate solutions. I worked with mobile developers
            to weigh anticipated impacts of each solution against the cost to
            implement it, and prioritized my list of problems/solutions.
            <br> <br>
            Upon identifying the problem I would be designing for, I conducted
            a competitive analysis of how other products handle similar user needs.
            I began ideating, sketching, mocking up, prototyping, and iterating.
            Along the way, I worked to prioritize accessibility best practices,
            I restructured information, collaborated with copywriters, altered
            visuals, designed new icons when necessary, and checked in regularly
            with the Atlassian Design Guidelines Team to be sure my work was ADG
            compliant.</p>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p class="body-p">I ended up creating a feature that I’m super excited to see roll out
            in the coming months. It capitalizes on mobile capabilities in order
            to reduce user anxiety related to on-the-go page creation. It
            challenges desktop-first mental models and truly takes mobile users’
            needs into account.
            <br><br>
            Again, I would be happy to speak further about this project privately.
